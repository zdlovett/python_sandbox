Changes:
Change the ip of Artoo to 10.1.1.2 in the /etc/network/interfaces file
Change the ip of Computer to 10.1.1.1 so that it will get the data headed to Artoo

pixhawk version:
1.2.19

If you want to forward the sticks to a non-solo device modify /etc/inittab to
echo the ip of the device that you want to sent to into /var/run/solo.ip once.
The stick info is a UDP packet with the following format:
Start
Byte    Size    Description
0       8       Timestamp, usec since stm32 process started
8       2       Sequence number
10      2       Channel 0       Left  up/down
12      2       Channel 1       Right left/right
14      2       Channel 2       Right up/down
16      2       Channel 3       Left  left/right
18      2       Channel 4       unknown
20      2       Channel 5       Left paddle integrated position
22      2       Channel 6       unknown
24      2       Channel 7       Left paddle current position
26 (packet length)

Per solo:
1) Kill the pair in /etc/inittab
    Change default run level to 4
    kill pixrc
    kill video send
    kill rssi send
    kill telem_forwarder
2) Change the /etc/network/interfaces file as seen below
      -iface wlan0 inet dhcp
      -       udhcpc_opts -x hostname:solo -T 1
      +iface wlan0 inet static
      +       address 10.1.1.XX
      +       netmask 255.255.255.0
      +       gateway 10.1.1.1
             wireless_mode managed
             wireless_essid any
             wpa-driver nl80211
3) Use sololink_config to update the ssid and password
      sololink_config --set-wifi-ssid SoloLink_Swarm
      sololink_config --set-wifi-password sololink
    These commands should echo the new setting to the terminal
    if they were successfully set.

4) Change /usr/bin/runMAVProxy.sh and replace the --master command
    with --master=/dev/ttymxc1 and add
          --baudrate=921600
          --rtscts
          --out=10.1.1.1:145XX
    where XX is the last block of the ip of the copter

Change the Pixhawk params:
arming_check -65 (skip rc)
fs_gcs_enable 1
fs_thr_enable 0
rtl_wait_time 0
arming timeout --This is not a exposed param, so it needs flight code changes


Version 2, using John's telem_forwarder:

1) Kill the pair in /etc/inittab
    Change default run level to 4
    kill pixrc
    kill pair
    kill video send
    kill rssi send
    kill mavproxy
2) Change the /etc/network/interfaces file as seen below
      -iface wlan0 inet dhcp
      -       udhcpc_opts -x hostname:solo -T 1
      +iface wlan0 inet static
      +       address 10.1.1.XX
      +       netmask 255.255.255.0
      +       gateway 10.1.1.1
             wireless_mode managed
             wireless_essid any
             wpa-driver nl80211
3) Use sololink_config to update the ssid and password
      sololink_config --set-wifi-ssid SoloLink_Swarm
      sololink_config --set-wifi-password sololink
    These commands should echo the new setting to the terminal
    if they were successfully set.

4) Change /etc/sololink.conf telemdest to 145XX where XX is the id
    update the sololink.conf.md5 so that the change persists past reboot.



Check to make sure that the RTL

Solo host TODO list:
Finish RTL ->may need to change the way we connect to pixhawk due to heartbeat from sololink
Fix ID on RTL
Stop spamming, better state detection
Fix Arming / setting (guided?) mode


Sending data to solo should just sent to (address, 14560)
